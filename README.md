## MVP: to-do for release/v1.0.0

- [ ] main.cpp

  - [x] print opencv and project version.
  - [x] add argument parser.
    - [x] number of car ROIs.
    - [x] number of pedestrian ROIs.
    - [x] debug toggle and view help.
    - [ ] check if total ROI <= number of cores.
  - [ ] create TrafficManager object.

- [ ] VideoCaptureModule

  - [ ] read from mp4 files (for debugging).
  - [ ] read from RTSP stream (for production) by loading environment variables from rtsp_links config file.
  - [ ] trim and warp frame based on the dictionary from lane_calib config file.
  - [ ] return warped frame.

- [ ] CalibrationModule (Only run once during calibration phase, assuming installed cameras don't move)

  - [ ] same with VideoCaptureModule, read from stream.
  - [ ] show frame that can also be accessed remotely (SSH).
  - [ ] click four points (resettable if unhappy) to define the image transformation matrix for warping the perspective to bird's eye view.
  - [ ] input the length and width of these corresponding lane points.
  - [ ] save the corresponding {stream-name, four-calibration-points} dictionary to a lane_calib config file, together with the length and width of lane.
  - [ ] (optional) add a line guide calculated from Hough line transform to snap to.

- [ ] HullRecognitionModule

  - [ ] switch between debug mode (with imshow) and release mode (no imshow).

  - [ ] create HullDetector

    - [ ] read cv_params config file to load constants of CV pipeline.
    - [ ] pre-process frame with grayscale and gaussian blur.
    - [ ] apply MOG2 background subtraction.
    - [ ] filter out shadows.
    - [ ] apply morphological operation (dilation then erosion, i.e. closing morph) with different kernels.
    - [ ] find contours and store their moments.

  - [ ] create HullTracker

    - [ ] get reference of moments of contours from HullDetector.
    - [ ] match existing tracked hulls by comparing current and previous hulls info [centroid, area] that is calculated from contour moments.
    - [ ] add new tracked hulls with unique ID, but reset count every start of green light change.
    - [ ] remove duplicates (same hull but assigned multiple IDs) and inactive tracked hulls.
    - [ ] return reliable tracked hulls.

  - [ ] create HullParametersBlender, to manually find CV parameters to get best Hull tracking results.
    - [ ] inherit from HullDetector, but with adjustable parameters.
    - [ ] create trackbar to adjust these parameters while showing all stacked frames as feedback.
    - [ ] save the adjusted parameters to the cv_params config file.

- [ ] TrafficDensityEstimator

  - [ ] return traffic density based if the state message from parent was Green, RedSet, or RedGet (IMPORTANT: this is only applicaple for car traffic, still not sure how to calculate together with the pedestrian topic).
    - [ ] Green: return nothing but confirmation message.
    - [ ] RedSet: return density of previous green light.
    - [ ] RedGet: return density of current red light.
  - [ ] calculate density of previous green light:
    - [ ] get the accumulated total hull area that crossed finish line (define this line later, maybe 80% of the length?).
    - [ ] get the start and end time of green light, then divide by the accumulated total hull area to get average traffic flow.
    - [ ] get the average speed parallel to lane by calculating a moving average, for each frame, delta centroid divided by delta frame_time. Make sure to get the vector projection parallel to lane.
    - [ ] divide average traffic flow by average speed and width of lane, and return this value as density of previous green light.
  - [ ] calculate density of current red light:
    - [ ] invoke a countStationaryCars from the StationaryDetectorModule to get the number of cars inside an ROI for one frame.
    - [ ] divide the number of cars by the length and width of lane to get density of current red light.

- [ ] StationaryDetectorModule

  - [ ] have not decided yet what to use to detect stationary cars during red light.
    - [ ] the classic Haar Cascade classifiers.
    - [ ] YOLOv8 for edge model.
  - [ ] This module should also be used for pedestrian detection/counting.

- [ ] TrafficManager

  - [ ] contructor to be initialized in main (should be initialized with number of ROIs for car and for pedestrian inputted as arguments).
  - [ ] load truth_table config file mapping the logic of green/red lights to lanes.
  - [ ] spawn processes (parallelized) based on the number of car + pedestrian ROIs.
  - [ ] create pipes to communicate state variables from parent to child, and communicate traffic density information from child to parent.
  - [ ] calculate traffic light timings based on results of received density info from children.
  - [ ] block until time for state change, then broadcast to the appropriate children processes their next state.
  - [ ] output signal to outside traffic light control.
  - [ ] (optional) create a traffic light control simulator to receive the signal.

- [ ] (Optional) HullDetectionOptimizer: To automize the manually set HullParametersBlender.

- [ ] Setup CMake
- [ ] Setup branch protection for `release/`

- [ ] Setup workflows

  - [ ] [Setup OpenCV action](https://github.com/Dovyski/setup-opencv-action).
  - [ ] Build and test CMake project on multiple platforms.

- [ ] Add test edge cases not covered by defaults
- [ ] Check threads and CPU usage in release
- [ ] Documentation with Doxygen

## Environments guide

- Write in **C++11** to conform to OpenCV coding style.
- Require **OpenCV 4.8.1** version (latest as of 2023/12/1) or above.
- Code should be cross-platform, but prioritize build on **Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS** (headless server to be deployed).
- Use **CMake 3.22.1** or above (latest stable version from apt in the above Ubuntu version).
- For Linux toolchain, use the following versions or above:
  - GNU Make 4.3
  - gcc, g++ version 11.4.0
  - gdb version 12.1
- For Windows, maybe try the following, in descending priority:
  - Ninja
  - MSYS Makefiles
  - MinGW Makefiles
  - Visual Studio 16/17 (2019/2022)

## Git convention style guide

- branch naming convention
  - long-term (M = Major, m = Minor, p = patch)
    - release/vM.m.p (protected)
    - dev/vM.m.p
  - short-term
    - feature/reference/description-in-kebab-case
    - test/...
    - bugfix/...
    - docs/...
- commits convention (please [read here](https://medium.com/@naandalist/creating-a-git-commit-message-convention-for-your-team-acb4b3edfc44) for reference)
  - commit title
    - feat: [write here descriptive subject]
    - fix: ...
    - docs: ...
    - style: ...
    - refactor: ...
    - test: ...
    - chore: ...
  - commit description (optional)
    - if title's subject is not descriptive enough, provide here more details

## Naming conventions

- Classes/Structs: PascalCase
- variables/functions: camelCase
- constants: ALL_CAPS
- namespace: lowercase, no underscores
- Class member prefixes: no need

dir names:

- Source files: PascalCase except `main.cpp`
- Header files: PascalCase
- Include Guard in Header files: ALL_CAPS separated with underscores
- Config files: snake_case
- Text files: snake_case except `CMakeLists.txt`
- Test files: start with `test_` then snake_case
- Resource files: snake_case
- Release builds: TrafficEZ-M.m.p-Linux64 or TrafficEZ-M.m.p-Win64.exe

## Styling/Formatting conventions

Please use clang formatter and load the .clang-format settings in root.
